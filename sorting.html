									<h2>The Sorting Ceremony</h2>
									<a class="image main"><img src="images/sortinghat.png" alt="sorting hat"/></a>
								</header>
									<p> A tall, black-haired woman in emerald robes waits for you at the door. She leads you and the other first years from 
									the Entrance Hall to an empty chamber on the left. You look around and see the tall stone walls lit up by torches. 
									“Welcome to Hogwarts, my name is Professor McGonagall. Before we can proceed, you need to be sorted into your houses. 
									The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Now follow me”. 
									<br><br> 
									Everyone forms a line and you follow Professor McGonagall through the big wooden double doors that lead into the Great Hall. 
									This Hall is lit by thousands of candles which are floating mid-air over four long tables, where all the other students 
									are sitting. She leads you and the other first years to the front of the hall. You notice that the ceiling appears to reflect the 
									sky with thousands of stars flickering in the night. Professor McGonagall places a stool in front of you and places a worn looking 
									wizard’s hat on top of it. You hear different names being called forward to sit on the stool. First up is Serena Bulstrode, 
									she is sorted into Slytherin. Next is your new friend Leonora Rosewood, who is also sorted into Slytherin. A boy you were 
									standing next to called Josiah Smith gets sorted into Hufflepuff. When your name is called you sit on top of the four-legged 
									stool and the professor puts the hat on top of your head. 
									<br><br>
									Now keep in mind, the sorting hat secretly holds into account what house you desire.
									</p>
