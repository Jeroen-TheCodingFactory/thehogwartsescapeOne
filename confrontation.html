									<h2>The Midnight Duel</h2>
								</header>
									<p>
									Your heart sinks as you start to realize exactly why Silas and Galen are attacking Leonora. 
									The book of Slytherin families. You remember reading about their families. Silas 
									Carrow and Galen Bulstrode both lost their family members by the hand of the Travers Family. 
									They must be taking out their anger on Leonora. You hear the voices getting angrier and louder 
									until you can’t listen anymore and jump out from behind the tree. 
<br><br>
									“Stop!” You scream as you step in front of Leonora. “Revenge won’t solve anything.” 
<br><br>
									“And what exactly do you know about revenge?” The boy with the dark hair asks you, his tone is cold.
<br><br>
									“I know that it won’t change the past.” You tell him. You quickly look at Leonora and ask if she’s alright. She tells you that she is fine, but she looks shaken. 
<br><br>
									“Look, Silas. So wise for an eleven-year-old.” The shorter boy says with a very sarcastic tone, who’s name you now know is Galen. 
<br><br>
									You think the best thing to do is go back to the castle, before things can get out of hand. You wrap your arm around Leonora, “Let’s go back” you whisper. You haven’t even reached the end of the forest when it happens..
<br><br>
									“No!” You hear a scream. A flash of red flies just past your ear. “Protego!” Leonora shouts.
<br><br>
									You hold out your wand. If it's a fight they want, you’ll be sure to give it to them.
