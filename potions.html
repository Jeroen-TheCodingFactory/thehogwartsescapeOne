									<h2>Potions Class</h2>
								</header>
									<p>
									It’s time for potions lesson so you walk to the dungeons. When you enter the classroom you see
									‘The Forgetfulness Potion’ written on the board in chalk. You and Leonora have been doing
									really well in this class, so you are surprised to find that she has a new partner today.
									You don’t think anything of it though and decide to find another partner for yourself.
									You sit down next to Leonora and her new partner, who’s name you think to be Serena. <br><br>

									You learn that the Forgetfulness Potion has three main ingredients: Lethe River Water, Mistletoe Berries,
									and Valerian Sprigs. While you’re brewing your potion with your new partner you can’t help but
									notice the uneasy look Leonora has on her face. Maybe she is having a hard time with the potion?
									You see that her new partner isn’t doing anything to help, she keeps staring out of the window and
									chatting to the boy next to her. This is why it surprises you when the professor compliments their
									potion and Serena takes all the credit. Leonora stays silent and just nods in agreement. This angers
									you and you shoot a glance at your friends, who have also picked up on this. <br><br>

									When class is over Leonora is the first person out of the classroom. You wait for Serena by the classroom door.
									When she walks past, you stop her and confront her about taking
									credit for Leonora’s potion. She laughs but it doesn’t sound sincere.
									<br><br>
									“You know nothing about that girl, why defend her? You don’t know the damage she has
									caused so please keep your face out of my business.” She tries to walk away but you block
									the door. You ask Serena what this means because your patience with her is really starting
									to run out. “You think she’s so nice then, don’t you? Then why didn’t she tell your her real
									last name. If you’re such good friends she must have told you about her family. Now let me
									go or I will scream for the professor.”
									<br><br>
									Irritated by her words you let her walk out of the classroom. But as annoying as Serena is,
									is she also a liar? Or is Leonora the one who is lying? You and your friends stare at each
									other in confusion, but before one of you can say anything Serena turns around and shouts
									that she left a clue to Leonora’s real last name in the potions classroom.
