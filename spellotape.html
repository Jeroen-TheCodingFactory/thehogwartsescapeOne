									<h2>You rescued Leonora!</h2>
								</header>
									<p>
									But of course! You can use diffindo to cut her down from the ceiling. Your friends get ready to catch her as you try to cut the Spellotape 
									with Diffindo. It takes a few tries since this spell is normally taught in the second year. But your wish to help Leonora gives you all the magic 
									strength you need. <br><br>
									“Leonora are you okay?” You ask her once you and your friends get her down safely.<br><br>
									“Those little-, yes I’m fine. Thank you guys for finding me. I don’t know what I would've done if it wasn’t for you guys.” Leonora says while she is smoothing out her clothes.<br> <br>
									“Who did this to you?” You ask her, ready to fight whoever could do such a thing. <br><br>
									“I don’t know” She answers. “They blurred my vision with some sort of spell and I could only hear their voices.” <br><br>She continues to explain 
									about the note and that they were waiting for her at the library and how they were calling her blood traitor and a murderer. 
									As you walk her to the Slytherin common room you ask her what all of this could mean but she says she has as little of an idea as you.
