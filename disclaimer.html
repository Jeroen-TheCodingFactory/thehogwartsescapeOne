								<p>
									We care about your privacy, so this website does not collect any personal information about you.
									<br><br>
									We do not use cookies for tracking, advertising, or analytics.
									We do not know who you are â€” and we are completely fine with that. ðŸ™‚
									<br><br>
									To keep the website running smoothly, we keep very basic server logs.
									These logs do not contain IP addresses. Instead, each IP address is replaced with the word "anonymous" before anything is saved.
									This means there is no way to link any visit to a specific person.
									<br><br>
									Even though the server technically receives your IP address when you connect (as all web servers do), we never store, save, or process it in any way.
									<br><br>
									The website does use one small cookie to remember if you have already seen the privacy message.
									This cookie is purely functional and exists only to improve your experience by not showing the same message over and over again.
									It does not store any personal information and is not used for tracking.
									<br><br>
									The website is hosted by MijnDomein, a Dutch hosting provider. While we manage the website content and functionality, MijnDomein is responsible for the technical 
									infrastructure and may process certain technical data (such as IP addresses and access logs) as part of their hosting service. This data is processed in accordance 
									with their privacy policy and only accessed when necessary for maintenance, security, or to comply with legal obligations.
									<br><br>
									This escape room is a fun, non-commercial hobby project. We do not operate as a company or business, and we offer this experience for free â€” just because we enjoy building it.
									<br><br>
									If you have any questions about privacy or how we handle data, feel free to contact us: <br>
