									<h2>A new mission</h2>
								</header>
									<p>
									It stays quiet for a few weeks apart from some childish pranks. A dead stinky fish in her sock drawer, 
									some more threatening notes and a bed drenched in water from the lake. After you find out her fingers 
									have turned black and blue because someone put mouse traps in her trunk you decide it’s enough. You confront 
									her about the “pranks” which by now sound like plain bullying. Leonora refuses to talk to her Prefect.
									She says it’ll just blow over if she keeps ignoring it. You’re not so sure. However, when you bring it up 
									to Leonora, she tries to change the subject as quickly as possible. You decide to let it go for now, but it 
									still doesn’t sit well with you. One thing is for sure, whoever is doing this to her has access to the 
									Slytherin common room and girls dormitories. 
									<br><br>
									Halloween comes around the corner and even Leonora seems more like herself the past couple of days. 
									You secretly hope that the bullying has stopped. The Great Hall is decorated with more than you and 
									your friends could have imagined. A thousand live bats fly over the four tables that have gold plates 
									on them. There are floating pumpkins and candles everywhere you look. You sit down at your house table, 
									thinking this would have to be the most amazing thing you have ever seen. But then the food appears on 
									the golden plates and the decoration drifts to the back of your mind. You eat all of your favourite food 
									and chat away happily with the people from your house.    
									<br><br>
									A week after Halloween you notice that Leonora has been getting more and more quiet again. You and your friends 
									are starting to get worried about her. You guys decide to do something about it, whether Leonora agrees 
									to it or not.
