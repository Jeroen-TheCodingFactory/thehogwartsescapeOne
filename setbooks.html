									<p>Wow! The brick you touch quivers - wriggles - in the middle, a small hole appears and gets wider and wider until you are standing in an archway that reveals a busy, cobbled street. <b>“Welcome to Diagon Alley.” </b>
								<br><br>The lively chatter amongst witches and wizards fills your ears. You look around at all the different shops.<br>
									The first shop you notice has a stack of cauldrons standing outside next to the entrance. The sign above it says <i>
									‘Cauldrons - all sizes - coppers, brass, pewter, silver, self stirring, collapsible’</i>. You walk along the street and notice a dark shop 
									that’s selling owls, called <i>‘Eeylops Owl Emporium - tawny, screech, barn, brown and snowy’</i>. 
									You pass another shop selling robes, called <i>‘Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions’</i>. 
									A shop that catches your eye is selling telescopes and strange silver instruments, you look up at the sign and it says <i>
									‘Wiseacre's Wizarding Equipment’</i>. As you walk by you overhear a few people walking out of the shop talking about their purchases: 
									a set of silver scales, a globe of the moon and some spellotape. You quickly wonder if you’ll be needing any of this. <br><br>
									After a stop at Gringotts you decide that schoolbooks are a good place to start. You walk into the shop called <i>
									‘Flourish and Blotts’</i> and see shelves that are stacked to the ceiling with books of every colour and size. 
									You get the supply list that came with your Hogwarts letter out of your pocket and look for the books.
