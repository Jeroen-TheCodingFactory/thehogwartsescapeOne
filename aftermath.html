									<h2>The Aftermath</h2>
								</header>
									<p>
									Leonora and you both use Petrificus Totalus successfully. Silas and Galen are both lying frozen on the ground. 
									Your heart is still beating fast as you turn to Leonora and ask her why she never told you any of this. She 
									tells you that she was ashamed of what her family did and that she cannot blame Silas or Galen. She continues 
									to explain that her family didn’t kill the Bulstrodes or the Carrows, but that when her family decided to leave 
									the Death Eaters after the Second Wizarding War, they exposed secrets about all the pureblood families who left. 
									This resulted in a feud between all the families who still stayed true to The Dark Lord and the families who turned 
									their backs on him. Unfortunately some fanatics felt that all traitors who left the Death Eaters should be killed 
									and that is exactly what happened. However, when they arrived at the Travers family home, they had been expecting 
									them and only Leonora’s grandad got killed in the fight. The families who lost so many lives always blamed 
									the Travers family ever since. 
									<br><br>
									You respond by telling her that you understand their pain but that she shouldn’t have to pay 
									for her family's’ mistakes. Leonora gives you a weak smile, but you can see that she’s still 
									unsure about it. 
									<br><br>
									Your friends finally catch up with you. They look at Silas and Galen and back to you and Leonora. Right when they’re about to ask something two professors come running up to you. The adrenaline of the fight and the feeling of victory slowly start to fade away when you realize what this could mean.
